b# Banff Log Cabin Project!

## Hi welcome to the repo!

There are two folders:

</br>

### **frontend**

> > make sure you are in the frontend directory!
> > </br>

> > you are good to start coding! PLEASE comment as MUCH as you can to explain your code and what it's doing. We are all learning and wanting to understand.
> > </br>

> > Please follow the naming conventions. Try and make the files all named the same way (hooks start with "use", components are always capitalized, stylesheets are "whatTheStyleIsFor.scss" etc.)</br>

> > In each component, there are the .js files and the .scss files. Please look into navbar for an example.

> > The css folder holds the reset and the global scss.

**Commands:**

from root, go into frontend:

```
cd frontend
```

node modules:

```
npm install
```

run the app live:

```
npm run start
```

</br>

### **strapi**

> > Try to avoid this folder unless you've been tasked into it. For best measures, try not to touch it lol.

## To practice pushes and branching, please write your name below, make a branch, and push it up. Do not push it into main, it will fail. If you're not sure how this works, there's lots of youtube videos. Thanks :)
